        <center><p class="parrafos">From an old fishing village to a tourist destination. Punta del Diablo is in the department of Rocha, it is very small, so you can visit it all in just two days . If you are curious why it's called like that , it is because there were many shipwrecks in the past. Punta del Diablo has a relaxed and bohemian style with many hotels, restaurants, crafts, bowling, designer shops and three beaches on the Atlantic Ocean: Playa de la Viuda, Playa del Rivero and Playa de los Pescadores. If you are looking for places like cabins, hotels and campsites for sport fishing or surfing, this is the ideal place. In winter you can see whales. The best season to travel to this city is from December to March. From this city there is not much information but is a good opinion for turists.
