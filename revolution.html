        <center><p class="parrafos">This revolution has been the bloodiest in the country. It was led by José Batlle y Ordóñez and had 5 different wars. This conflict began because of one of the leaders of the most prestigious National Parties, Carmelo Cabrera. Cabrera had been having some problems with the Brazilians, who were traveling at that time, particularly in Rio Grande do Sul, due to a tense political situation. On Sunday, November 1, 1903, a Brazilian named Gentile Gomes committed some excesses, which caused Cabrera to arrest him and some of his henchmen. But some time later, some 400 men arrived from Ataliva Gomes, the brother of Gentil Gomes, mayor of Santa Ana do Livramento, demanding his release.Cabrera had 100 armed men and with them he tried to negotiate with the Brazilians, he was able to reach an agreement to release all the detainees except Gentil Gomez since he was imprisoned by court order. The president ordered that Gentil Gomes not be released, so the Brazilians forced their way into Rivera to take him back. But in the middle of the night, in the midst of all the shooting and fighting, one of the people who was guarding Gentile set him free. But then to expel all the military leaders it was quite difficult for the country. Thanks to this incident, all these wars and revolutions started. </p></center>
