        <center><p class="parrafos">The Rio Negro is one of the most important rivers in Uruguay. One reason for this is that it provides water and food to 45 registed indigenous communities in the country, also some goups of descendants from African slaves communities. It is a very touristic place for adventurous people so it helps the economy of people that work on touristic things there and also for the country. People also like to go and see the different types of lifestyles and learn new things with different experiences that a new space can bring you. Keeping with the things about the river is that one of the main. One of the main things to be aware of is that the river has very deep parts and it could cause accidents and the country is not involved in that because you are in your own responsibility (recommendation: be aware that there are animals and also that is the deepest river in Uruguay),  but if you want to take great photos is a great place. Also there are a lot of wild animals that get to be cute, there are many people and parks for tourists going and seeing animals in the river. For a safer place to go and visit my recommendation is that you can go with your family go to a park called Esteros de Farrapos National Park, that is a park in which it has a system of fluvial wetlands, islands and islets that are permanently and/or temporarily flooded as a result of the flooding of the river. </p></center>
