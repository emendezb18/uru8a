        <center><p class="parrafos">If you would like to travel to a beautiful place that have variety of things to do Punta Del Este is for you. It is a city located in the extreme southeast in the department of Maldonado in Uruguay, at five kilometers from the capital (Montevideo) there is this beautiful city known internationally for being considered as one of the most beautiful cistern city in center and south America. In Punta del Este as I all ready told you has many things you can do and is perfect to by yourself, some of thouse activities are  musical and theatrical shows, film and music festivals, fashion shows, casinos and nightclubs; but like in every city there are also things you can go tho do with family or to rest because is a coustern city you could reserve a hotel that is near to the ocean and spend some time there.
        Something that many people like is that is the perfect combination between nature and human civilization, people most like the  Beautiful beaches, crystal clear waters, forests and architecture of this fantastic city. If you want to go to relax in some beaches you could go to Isla de lobos that you could go on a ship that for kids form 4-11 years would cost approximately 5- 6 dollars and for older people would be 11- 12 dollars, many of the islands and natural parks  you can go to for similar costs, my recommendations are that you should go to the folowing islands: Isla Gorriti, La Barra or/ and Arboretum Lussich. If you want to go to were is very turistic and is inside normal city you could go to the sculpture  of the gigant hand that is on a beach, Casapueblo, el Puente Garzón and a famous museum called Museo Del Mar  this are places you dont need to go all day so if you go to this places you could do other activities like go shopping and all of that. 
        Like we all know for a incredible things happening there should be a history and for this city is not an exception in 1826 Francisco Aguilar and leal  for making a tribute to the patriots who fought in the Battle of Ituzaingó ( it was a battle for dividing a peace of land).  So in my opinion I think that is perfect because you can have a perfect travel that has variety of things to do/ visit. </p></center>
