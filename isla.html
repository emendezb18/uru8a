        <center><p class="parrafos">Small, but beautiful. Isla de los Lobos is a small island, in which very beautiful sea seals live. The entire island is approximately 4.68 km, and only 4 people live on the island. This island is not a place where you can live like any city, this island is like the home of some seals that are on the southern shores of the Atlantic Ocean. This island has become a place where you can go in summer to spend the day to see the wonderful seals. The ticket costs 15 euros per adult and 7.50 euros for people between 4 and 11 years old.
        This place has a very important meaning in the world, since when the Europeans discovered America, they went to this island and killed 60 seals to eat, while they returned to Europe, they used the oil of the seals to use in lighting systems in the city of Maldonado. A curious fact about this island is that if the name "island of the wolves" refers to the seals that live there, in Spanish, the Spaniards call the seals "sea wolves", that is why they named the island "Wolf Island"</p></center>
